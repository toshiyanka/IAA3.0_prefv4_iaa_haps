  <sip_features>
<![CDATA[- Endpoint is now VISA 2.14 compliant.
- Added deterministic clock crossing for the asynchronous endpoint configuration.
- Release includes UPF scripts defining isolation and retention intent for power-aware simulation.
- Added fscan_shiften to top of endpoint and base.
- Added fdfx_rst_b to top of endpoint.
- Fixed side_clkreq to assert during reset.
- Updated back-end flows to test with real 1271/1273 cells.

- Please note that Sideband Endpoint instantiations need to be uniquified in all IP's per the SEG POR instantiation and uniquification methodology.
- Please note that the Sideband Endpoint cell map file needs to be updated per IP instantiation to replace generic library cells.
- SoC Library Instantiation and Uniquificiation web page.

<![CDATA[- This release has NO uniquification applied. All end users are required to uniquify the design as appropriate to avoid module collisions with
instances of the endpoint in other IPs.
- Review README in root release directory for instructions how to run test and backend tools.
