-     This is example env and testbench created with one router with 8 agents
      all agents are configured using do_create_network API.
-     Example network lv0_sbr_cfg_1.xml is used in this case.
-     env instantiates iosf_sbc_agent_vc for each node (in this case total 8),
      and also instantiates one rtr_sb.
-     users need to configire agtvc_cfg for each agent based on its 
      sideband network
-     users also need to configure rtr_cfg and common_cfg which is 
      required for rtr_sb
-     gnerally we use XML file which specifes sideband network, 
      but user can refer to their MAS/HAS for correct sideband 
      network configuration

-     For this example we have used lv0_sbr_cfg_1.xml file which 
      specified how each agent is conencted to the router and each 
      agent's config fields, for example, payload_width, and buffer sizes.
-     We would recommand to first study this example env, xml and testbench 
      and see how the different config members are configured based on the XML.
-     User will then have better idea about how to configure 
      agtvc_cfg, rtr_cfg and common_cfg
-     Users can ignore clk_rst and pmu_vc related config and methods since
      these VCs are created only for our internal validation and 
      are not being reused by your project.
