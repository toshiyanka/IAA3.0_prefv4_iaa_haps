This is the Emulation-FPGA Friendly Methodology (EFFM) framework of tools that
are part of emul_build_soc utility that is integrated into ACE, Simbuild and HDK fron-end sim env. These generally don't require any project customization. Project-level customizations are provided through the setup file - emul_build_soc.cfg, found in flows package.


All of these files normally reside in project's $MODEL_ROOT/tools/emulation  dir which is part of the design repo. 
These files may require some customization to meet each project requirements at different phases of the project.
