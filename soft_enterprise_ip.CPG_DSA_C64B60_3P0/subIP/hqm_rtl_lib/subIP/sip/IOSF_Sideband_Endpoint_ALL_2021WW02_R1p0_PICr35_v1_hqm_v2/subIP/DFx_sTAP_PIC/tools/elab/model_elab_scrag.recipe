# This is example on how to create a RECIPE for creating run script around 'ace calculated  model elab command'
# Available Usage syntax:
#      i. environment variables
#             $ENV{ACE_HOME}
#      ii. Elaboration command key word.  This is where the ace caclucated  model elab command to be placed
#              _ELAB_COMMAND_
#      iii. Reference to ACE flag
#                <scope_name::flag name> 
#      iv. Locate file on 'ace -show_search_path'
#                  FIND_FILE:'partial path to file' 
#      v. Locate directory on 'ace -show_search_path'
#                  FIND_DIR:'partial path to directory' 
#      vi. Only one Unix command per-line can be specified
# The user may inject UNIX command before/after _ELAB_COMMAND_ command.  
# Or, the user may write a wrapper script around _ELAB_COMMAND_ command

#Example:

# locate Readme file on search path and copy to  model elab execution directory.
cp FIND_FILE:doc/templates/Readme .

# example on some other command with ENV var in it.
ls $ENV{ ACE_HOME }/doc/templates/

# example on referencing ace  flag
tree <-model_compile_results_dir>/makefiles

# the ace calcuated command executes here
_ELAB_COMMAND_
echo "COPY the Elab log to the tools/reports directory for zirconQA checks _______________________________________\n"; 
latest_log=`ls -Art <-model_compile_results_dir>/logs/Compile_vcs.log | tail -n 1`
\cp $latest_log $IP_ROOT/tools/reports/stap_vcs.log

# example of unix command to run after  model elab
echo DONE_WITH_ELAB_SCRAG_RECIPE
