********* The results of the Security Risk Assessment *********

On the IOSF (Primary or Sideband), does the IP implement SAI protections on the IP registers? - No <-- INVESTIGATE --> 
Are the SAI access control policies reconfigurable? - No 
On the IOSF (Primary or Sideband), can the IP generate new transactions, which are not related to a response, without SAI protection? - No 
Does the IP implement any “lock bits” or “locking” mechanisms for access control protection? - No 
Does the IP depend on a peer or external component for any access control restrictions, excluding DFx? - No 
Does the IP include a bridge or the capability to bridge from IOSF-Sideband to IOSF-Primary or vice versa? - No 
Does the IP make access control decisions based on anything other than SAI? - No 
Does the IP label its material using the DFx security encodings (“Red”, “Orange”, “Green”)? - Yes 
Through JTAG under the “Green” DFx security encoding, can the IP be configured to cause permanent damage e.g. overdrive phys, Vcc to GND, etc.? - No 
Through JTAG under the “Green” DFx security encoding, can the configuration register access control protection mechanism be modified e.g. overriding SAI or “locking” protections, etc.? - No 
Is there any logic in the IP that can be used to bypass DFx protections? - No 
Is there logic in the IP that adds extra security protections to the DFx security encodings? - No 
Do any of the hard strap or “Ad-hoc” pins undermine any security protections e.g. SAI, DFx, etc? - No 
Through any of the exposed interfaces, including the hard strap or “Ad-hoc” pins, can the IP be permanently damaged or configured to prematurely fail i.e. Vcc to Gnd, over clocked, overdrive phys,etc.? - No 
Through any of the exposed interfaces, are there any “marketable or upgraded” features that can be enabled e.g. unlock/enable a feature that is disabled for a given SKU such as increasing operating frequency, lane size, etc.? - No 
Are there any access control restrictions on the configuration registers that support Dynamic Voltage or Frequency Switching (DVFS)? - No <-- INVESTIGATE --> 
Does the IP alter the overall system boot sequence or how the system recovers from errors? - No 
Is the IP susceptible to voltage or clock manipulations that could affect a security protection? - No 
Does the IP support any privilege-level or privilege-escalation modes e.g. VTx, protected mode, etc.? - No 
Does the IP have the ability to change power states e.g. thermal shutdown, reset, etc.? - No 
Does the IP externally expose any unique identifiers? - No 
During a save or restore, is the IP responsible for preserving any configuration data? - No 
Does the IP contain a DMA engine and can have unrestricted access to Host memory? - No 
Does the IP shadow any registers? - No 
Does the IP support any one-time programmable bits (OTP) that can be unlocked or overridden? - No
