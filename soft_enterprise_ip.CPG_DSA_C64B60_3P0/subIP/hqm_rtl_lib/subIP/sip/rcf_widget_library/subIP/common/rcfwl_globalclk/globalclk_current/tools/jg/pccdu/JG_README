Your 10nm JasperGold area is ready to use.  To bring up JasperGold by running:

    1) source jg_env.sh
    2) jg gclk_pccdu_jg_setup.tcl

The gclk_pccdu_jg_setup.tcl file that has been created for you should take care of common includes and +defines+ used by your build.  However, it is normal to further tweak this file for your own usage model.  

Anything you put in this file will automatically be run when JasperGold starts.  So you may want to add clock and reset commands to this file for your convenience, as an example.
