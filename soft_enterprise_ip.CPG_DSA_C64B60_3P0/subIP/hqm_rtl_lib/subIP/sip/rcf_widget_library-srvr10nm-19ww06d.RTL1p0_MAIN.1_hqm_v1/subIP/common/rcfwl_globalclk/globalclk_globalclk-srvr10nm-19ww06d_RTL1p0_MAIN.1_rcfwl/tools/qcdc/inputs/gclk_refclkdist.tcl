# Caution: clocks that are not grouped are considered as synchronous.
# Impact:  QuestaCDC does not report crossings as violations.

# Define clocks
# netlist clock cpu_clk_in -period 50
netlist clock { x12clk_in} -period 832 -waveform {0 416} -group x12clk
#netlist clock {pgcb_clk} -period 2496 -waveform {0 1248}

# Define constants
# netlist constant scan_mode 1'b0

# Define Port Clock Domain - optional
# netlist port domain { input_signal } -clock { cpu_clk_in }

# Define Blackbox
#netlist blackbox rcfwl_ClockDomainController
