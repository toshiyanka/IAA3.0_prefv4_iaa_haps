 
Script checks following issues 
  1. All +defaults/-defaults are having same arguments
  2. No default string included in the list
  3. .repeat count should be even in a list
  4. there should not be  "++" string included in the list
  5. comments should not have .include or -dirtag
 
 Script execution command
 % <scriptpath>.py
 e.g. ./misc_err_test.py

Input: -
Output:	<directory of script>/outlog/out_file_DD_Mon_YYYY, a list of testcases yet to be approved.
	Output is also mailed to a list of recipients/debuggers, depending on succesful run of the test or not.


Current script configuration:
1. Result and error mails 
 i. Both sent to the user who executes the script and nityajos
 ii. Recipients can be edited in ListOwners and MailList
2. Directories and subdirectories being read
 i. Main directory (defaultArea) currently set to $IP_MODELS/hqm/hqm-srvr10nm-wave4-latest/verif/tb/hqm/reglist
 ii. Input subdirectories of this path
 iii. If absolute directory paths are to be input, change defaultArea to "" and add complete paths to lst.

How does the script work?
1. opens the folder.
2. calls a function to check for +/-defaults balance.
3. for each file in the folder, that function scans each line.
4. if first word is +defaults, save the line contents.
5. if first word is -defaults, see if corresponding line has been saved in +defaults or not. 
5. print filename into output file if imbalance encountered.
6. the script calls a function to check for spelling errors like +/-default and ++
7. scans each line of the files till a spelling error is encountered and reports it.
8. a function is called to see if even number of .repeat were called. reports if odd .repeat called. 
9. commented out testcases/testfiles are detected by searching for #.include and -dirtag in comments
10. print numer of files scanned in the folder
11. move onto the next folder, if any, and repeat. 
12. mail the output file to mail recipients. 
13. If any error occurs in code execution, mail traceback to list of debuggers.
