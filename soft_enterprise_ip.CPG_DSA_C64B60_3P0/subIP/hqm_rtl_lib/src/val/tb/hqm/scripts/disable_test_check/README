Script checks for unintended disabling of various modes while running a regression.

 Script execution command
 % <scriptpath>.py
 e.g. ./disable_test_check.py

Input: -
	Following are input files
		1. bg_ex: tests and testlists reviewed to be excluded from BG CFG regressions
		2. ag_ex: tests and testlists reviewed to be excluded from AG CFG regressions
		3. ph_ex: tests and testlists reviewed to be excluded from PH CFG regressions
		4. ism_ex: tests and testlists reviewedto be excluded from ISM CFG regressions
		5. com_ex: tests and testlists reviewed to be excluded from ALL regressions

Output: -
	1. <directory of script>/outlog/out_file_DD_Mon_YYYY, a list of testcases yet to be approved.
	2. Output also mailed to a list of users


Current file configuration: 
1. Five files needed for input
 i. Four individual lists ( bg_ex, ag_ex, pc_ex, and ism_ex, one list for each mode) listed in lst.
 ii. One common list (com_ex)
 iii. List contents can be testcases or paths to lists containing more cases 
2. Output mail recipients:
 i.  If script executes: nityajos, vijayaga and the script executing user (MailList)
 ii. If script gets errors: nityajos and script executing user (ListOwners)
 iii. If all testcases are reviewed: script executing user only
3. Information for new mode:
 i. Name of the mode
 ii. Keyword to be searched
 iii. List of approved testcases
 iv. Abbreviaton to be used for the mode
 v. add the list of this information as an element in lst 


For each mode, the script executes the following steps:
1. creates a working copy of the approved list.
2. scans each line
3. if a testcase is present, add it to a main list of testcases.
4. if a file is included, open it and repeat the same procedure on that file.
5. execute the same function on the common approved list
6. After compiling a list of approved cases, script opens the simregress output file.
7. for each testcase of the specific mode (found using the keyword), if it does not match with any entry in the main approved list, it is added to output list. 
8. testcase count yet to be approved is appended at the beginning of the document
9. output file is mailed to recipients.
10. if any step fails, output file saves a traceback and it is mailed to the debuggers.
11. Files created by the script are deleted; output file is shifted to outlog directory.
