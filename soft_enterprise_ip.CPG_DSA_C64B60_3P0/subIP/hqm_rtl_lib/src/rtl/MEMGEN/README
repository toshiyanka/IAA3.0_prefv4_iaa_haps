Run HQM_MEM_GEN.scr, which calls other scripts in this directory to create memory-related collateral for HQM.

Input is the per-partition <par>mem.config files which specify the type/size/name of each logical memory.  These
config files are created by mem_access.perl.

Other inputs are the underlying AW files associated with these memories.

Outputs include:
- memory container rtl for each partition's memories, grouped by type, clock and pg; and the per-partition
  mem wrapper to instantiate them
- uniquified copies of the per-memory-instance AW files, with corresponding updates to AW_mem_lib.hdl
- collage fet_en connectivity scripts with arbitray ordering, per partition
- collage isolation connectivity scripts, per partition
- upf files for each partition's memories (power connections and HIP load_upf)
- verilog assertions for PGCB fet_en vs. memory instance pm

// NOTE: These scripts have been seen to produce different results (logically equivalent but different
// line order) when run under SLES12 (vs. SLES11).  If you run under SLES12 and see unexpected file changes,
// they should be reviewed to confirm they are equivalent, and then discarded.  The script output ordering
// will be fixed in future versions of HQM but not fixed HQMV25 in order to minimize churn.
