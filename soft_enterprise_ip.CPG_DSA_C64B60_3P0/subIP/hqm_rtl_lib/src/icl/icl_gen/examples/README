The folder contains TAP RDL/ICL collateral for the following design configurations:

   single_tap/                   : IP with single TAP
   rtdr_shared/                  : IP with TDR registers (shared SI/SO ports), no TAP
   rtdr_shared_encoded_sel/      : IP with TDR registers and encoded selects (shared SI/SO ports), no TAP
   rtdr_separate/                : IP with TDR registers (separate SI/SO ports), no TAP
   ijtag/                        : IP with single IJTAG chain, no TAP
   multi_tap_rtdr/               : IP with multiple TAP's and separate (individual) TDR registers
   data_port_export/             : example of parallel data in/out port export (based on multi-tap example)
   tap_with_blackbox_tdr/        : example of TAP with blackboxed TDR (variable size TDR which cannot be modeled)
   tap_with_rtdr_interface/      : example of TAP with external RTDR (connected using host scan/rtdr interface)
   multiple_tdr_resets/          : example of IP with mulitple TAP's/RTDR's in different power/reset domains
   tap_with_feature_en_security/ : example of TAP with Intel feature_en security
   single_tap_param/             : Parameterized IP with single TAP
   rtdr_separate_param/          : Parameterized IP with TDR registers (separate SI/SO ports), no TAP
   multi_tap_rtdr_param/         : Parameterized IP with multiple TAP's and separate (individual) TDR registers

Additional collateral:
   rtl/              : simple RTL for tessent/pattern generation (interface-only)
   tessent/          : simple tessent dofile for pattern generation
