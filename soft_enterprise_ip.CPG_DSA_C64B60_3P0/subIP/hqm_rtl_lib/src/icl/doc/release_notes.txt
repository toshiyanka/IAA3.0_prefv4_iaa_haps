    DESCRIPTION :
		  
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DUVE-M - DTEG Unified Verification Environment for IEEE 1687 ICL/PDL infrastructure.

Contains generic TAP tests to cover complete RTL vs. ICL validation and set of API/utilities
to access TAP/TDR architectural characteristics in Tessent ICL Data Model.

Developed and maintained by Intel's DTEG organization
Lead:  Igor Molchanov

Release: 2020ww24 igor.v.molchanov@inel.com

   1. Initial release

Release: 2020ww26 igor.v.molchanov@inel.com

   1. Update of configuration files: structure, names, content
   2. New knobs to control pattern file(s) generation and enabling/disabling of individual tests
   3. Dedicated config files for hotfix exclusions

Release: 2020ww27 igor.v.molchanov@inel.com

   1. ip_pattern_cfg.do: individual enable/disable for TLR & TRST tests
   2. ip_pattern_cfg.do: option to exclude specified security levels for security tests
   3. ip_test_cfg.do: examples of using '*' and '.' for all opcodes/security tests
   4. gen_val_tests.do: fixed location of set_ijtag_retargeting_options command
   5. tap_tests_common.pdl: fix of all opcode/security tests to support single TAP IP scope (".")
   6. tap_utils.pdl: supporting of single TAP IP scope (".")
   7. tap_tests_all.pdl: supporting of generating individual tests per group and exclusion of specified security levels

Release: 2020ww38 igor.v.molchanov@inel.com

   1. ICLGEN (TAP RDL2ICL) is a part of DUVE-M now (icl_gen/ folder)
   2. ICLGEN: supporting RTDR/IJTAG-only IPs (no TAP) and IPs with mix of TAPs and individual registers/chains
   3. ICLGEN: data in/data out port export feature
   4. ICLGEN: examples of collateral for supported IP configurations in the examples/ folder
   5. DUVE-M: added User Guide & Product Brief (covering ICLGEN too)
   6. DUVE-M: new tests:
                 - HTAP TAPSELECT TLR reset (htap/htap_tapselect_reset.pdl)
		 - HTAP TAP level security  (tap_tests_common.pdl: ip_tap_access_security_test, status: beta)

Release: 2020ww49 igor.v.molchanov@inel.com

   1. ICLGEN: New supported design configurations
       - Individual RTDR's with encoded selects
       - Powergood reset per TDR - for TDR's in different power domains
       - Blackboxed TDR's - for TDR's which behavior cannot be described with ICL
       - Host scan interfaces - for external RTDR's
       - Feature_en-based Intel security for TAP
   2. RDL/ICL collateral examples for new design configurations
   3. Updated User Guide
   4. DUVE-M: improved support of user-defined tests

Release: 2021ww05 igor.v.molchanov@inel.com

   1. ICLGEN: Register/field size parameterization support in the generated ICL
