1. These modules are used when repeaters are enabled between the EP and the IP.
2. There was a new PCR for a timing fix in these repeaters and hence there are 2 versions of the modules (with and without "_new" in their names).
3. The "new" repeater modules is exactly same as the old one logically, except that it has sequential and combo logics separated into different modules. This gives the user the ability to place the combo block closer to their IP's, to meet their timing requirements. For more details on this refer to HSD: 1405851011.
4. The following files are added/modified to support this
        subIP/reference_code/sberep_mst_new.sv
        subIP/reference_code/sberep_mstmux.sv
        subIP/reference_code/sberep_tgt_new.sv
        subIP/reference_code/sberep_tgtmux.sv
        subIP/reference_code/sberepeater_new.sv
        subIP/reference_code/sberepmux_top.sv
        subIP/reference_code/sberepmux_wrap.sv
        verif/tb/ep_tb/rpt_module_wrap_new.sv
        verif/tb/ep_tb/tb_top_new_repeater.sv
        ace/iosf_sbc_ep.hdl

5. Follow these steps to enable the new repeaters
    a. Swap the tb_top_new_repeater.sv with tb_top.sv (this will be the new tb_top).
    b. Choose if the target and master combo logic needs to be separated or within their respective target/master main repeater block. This can be done by setting the SPLIT_COMBO parameter.
